🚗 BMW Car Sales — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project presents a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on BMW’s global car sales dataset.
The objective is to uncover sales trends, identify top-performing models, and understand customer preferences across regions, fuel types, and transmission categories.

📘 Project Overview

This analysis walks through the full EDA workflow — including data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insights generation — using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

The goal is to understand how BMW’s sales evolved over time and what factors influence market demand.
